# VSRCNN - Video Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network

## Description

CNN built with Python TensorFlow Keras.

PyQT is used for creating a desktop app.

In order to use VSRCNN you simply open vsrcnn.exe and upload a video.

The app will produce the same video with a resolution multiplied by 4.

For example, you have an old video with 480x270 resolution. 
By using this app you can get a video with 1920x1080 resolution.

Model is fitted with [Vimeo90K dataset](http://toflow.csail.mit.edu/)
